          <h2 class="section-heading">Call for Papers</h2>

          <p> The <strong>European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys)</strong> is a premier international forum for presenting computer systems research. EuroSys 2026 seeks papers in all areas of computer systems research, including:</p>
            
          <p>
                <li> Operating systems</li>
                <li> Distributed systems</li>
                <li> Cloud computing and datacenter systems</li>
                <li> File and storage systems</li>
                <li> Networked systems</li>
                <li> Language support and runtime systems</li>
                <li> Systems security and privacy</li>
                <li> Dependable systems</li>
                <li> Analysis, testing and veriﬁcation of systems</li>
                <li> Database systems and data analytics frameworks</li>
                <li> Virtualization and virtualized systems</li>
                <li> Systems for machine learning/machine learning for systems</li>
                <li> Mobile and pervasive systems</li>
                <li> Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems</li>
                <li> Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems</li>
				<li> Systems for emerging hardware</li>
				            
           </p>

            <p> We encourage papers that span multiple topics and communities. Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. The program committee seeks papers that address a significant problem with an interesting and compelling solution whose validity and practicality are clearly demonstrated through rigorous evaluation. A good paper will describe and justify the design and evaluation methodology in detail, draw appropriate conclusions based on evaluation results, honestly present and compare against related prior work, and acknowledge its own limitations. Every paper should clearly articulate the advances that it offers over prior work.</p>
        
			<p> Separately from the preceding criteria for evaluating research papers, we are also inviting industry researchers to submit well-written, informative <strong>Industrial Experience</strong> papers relating their experience deploying, evolving, and/or operating their systems. These papers will also be judged based on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity, but vis-a-vis the lessons obtained from these deployments and how valuable they are likely to be for the systems research community. Importantly, we expect the major lessons and claims to be supported through quantitative analyses and rigorous methodology. </p>
			
			<p> Regardless of paper type, rigorous evaluation is a hallmark of a good systems paper.  We strongly recommend reading Gernot Heiser’s write-up on <a href="https://gernot-heiser.org/benchmarking-crimes.html">Systems Benchmarking Crimes</a> and ensuring you avoid these “crimes” in your evaluation. </p>
            
			
			
			<h2 class="section-heading" id="conf-dates">Important dates</h2>

            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" id="new-eurosys">Two Deadlines</h2>
			
			<p>EuroSys 2026 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the associated reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by EuroSys, for example, listing them on CVs.</p>
			
			<p>A paper submitted at the Spring deadline for EuroSys 2026 and rejected may not be submitted again until the Spring deadline for EuroSys 2027. A paper submitted at the Fall deadline for EuroSys 2026 and rejected may not be submitted again until the Fall deadline for EuroSys 2027.</p>
			
            <h2 class="section-heading" id="new-eurosys">Revision</h2>
			
			<p>Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of a one-shot revision. If offered a revision option, authors can choose to revise and resubmit the paper for the subsequent EuroSys deadline. This will be the EuroSys 2026 Fall deadline if offered a revision after a Spring submission. If the revision is accepted, the paper will be presented at EuroSys 2026.  If offered a revision after a Fall 2026 submission, authors may revise and resubmit to the subsequent (EuroSys 2027) Spring deadline for publication (if accepted) and presentation at EuroSys 2027.</p>
			
			<p>Authors offered a revision option will be given a list of necessary conditions for the paper to be accepted. These may include providing additional analysis,  experimental results, or performance comparisons that substantiate the claims of the paper or rebuttal response. The re-submission should include the revised paper, a version of the paper in which the differences from the first submission are clearly marked, and a separate high-level summary of the differences between the two versions. Please note that the interval between Spring notification and Fall deadline is ~4.5 weeks, hence we encourage authors to proactively substantiate claims seen as questionable by the PC when the initial reviews are first made available for the Spring deadline.</p>
			
			<p>A revision option is not a guarantee of acceptance. The revised and resubmitted paper will be re-evaluated by the PC. The paper can still be rejected if the revision conditions are not met; if new assertions are made without adequate support; or if the revised version unveils significant new concerns that were hidden in the original submission. Revised and resubmitted papers will receive either an accept or a reject decision; there will be no further revision option. If accepted, the paper will be subject to the usual shepherding process.</p>

			<h2 class="section-heading" id="new-eurosys">Resubmission and Concurrent Submissions</h2>
			
			<p>Authors submitting to EuroSys must adhere to ACM's policy on <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions">Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions</a>. If a revision option is offered and accepted, the paper is still considered under submission to EuroSys and still subject to this policy until it is explicitly withdrawn or rejected. If a revision option is offered and declined, the same policy applies as for a rejection.</p>
			
			<p>If a paper initially submitted to the Spring deadline of EuroSys 2026 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the Fall deadline of EuroSys 2027. If a paper initially submitted to the Fall deadline of EuroSys 2026 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the Spring deadline of EuroSys 2028.</p>

			<h2 class="section-heading" id="new-eurosys">Submission Instructions</h2>
			
			<h3 class="section-subheading">Spring Submission URL: <a href="https://eurosys26-spring.hotcrp.com/">https://eurosys26-spring.hotcrp.com/</a></h3>
			
			<h3 class="section-subheading">Fall Submission URL: <a href="https://eurosys26-fall.hotcrp.com/">https://eurosys26-fall.hotcrp.com/</a></h3>
				
			<p><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Reviewing is double-blind, meaning that the authors’ identities will be hidden from the reviewers and vice versa. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments).</p>
			
			<p>Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say “Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Smith et al. [17]”.</p>
			
			<p>A submission may extend a previous workshop paper, or it may relate to a submission currently under review. In these cases, you must still explain the differences between your present submission and the other work, but you should cite the other work anonymously and submit the anonymized work in a designated field in the HotCRP submission system (visible only to the PC chairs).</p>
			
			<p>Authors are permitted to post drafts of their submission on e.g. arXiv or as technical reports on their institution’s website. However, the submitted version should have a substantially different title, and a different system/tool name (if it uses one) from the draft version.</p>
			
			<p>Authors are welcome to include links to code repositories in their papers. However, authors should ensure that following the link and exploring the repository does not reveal any information about the names of the authors or their affiliations.</p>
			
			<p>Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review. EuroSys applies ACM’s policies for plagiarism, conflicts of interest, submission confidentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, whether or not your submission meets these guidelines, or have specific questions about the guidelines, please contact the PC chairs, eurosys26pcchairs@gmail.com, well in advance of the submission deadline.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Generative AI:</strong> Please review the ACM Policy on Authorship (<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship</a>), which contains information on the use of generative AI when preparing submissions.
			
			<p><strong>Conflicts:</strong> When registering and submitting your paper, you will need to provide information about conflicts with PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:</p>
			
			<p>
			<li><em>Institution:</em> You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution.</li>
			<li><em>Advisor or Collaborator:</em> You have a past or present association as thesis advisor/advisee, or you have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (2023 or later), or reasonably expect one within the next year.</li>
			</p>
			
			<p>A textbox will be provided on the submission page to explain any concerns about conflicts of interest. Further details on the conflict of interest policy can be found at the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">ACM website</a>.</p>

			<p> The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having an individual review your paper may lead to the submission being rejected without review. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the PC chairs, <a href="mailto:pc-chairs-2026@eurosys.org">pc-chairs-2026@eurosys.org</a>.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Page limit and formatting:</strong> Submissions must have at most <strong>12 pages</strong> of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, appendices, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. In addition, submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for supplementary material in a separate file, which can be uploaded separately on the submission site. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material, but authors may use this space for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the submission.</p>

			<p>Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by ≥8 mm (0.33″) of whitespace. Use ≥10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on ≥12-point (single-spaced) leading for all text including figure and table captions. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered. Authors are encouraged to hyperlink their references.</p>
			
			<p>Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN Latex (<code>\documentclass[sigplan, … ]</code>) or MS Word templates from here. For any paper parameters not defined above, assume that the required value is the one used in these templates.</p>
			
			<p>Papers that deviate significantly from the formatting instructions will be administratively rejected.</p>
			
			<p>For Latex, we recommend you use (where <code>&lt;PAPER_ID&gt;</code> is the paper ID you received after abstract registration):</p>
			
			<pre><code>
\documentclass[sigplan,twocolumn,review,anonymous]{acmart}
\acmSubmissionID{&lt;PAPER_ID&gt;}
\renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}
% Optional: Remove the ACM reference between the abstract and the main text.
\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printacmref=false}
% Optional: Comment out the CCS concepts and keywords.
...
			</code></pre>
			
			<h3 class="section-subheading">Revision Submissions</h3>			
			
			<p>If you are submitting a revised paper because you received a revise-and-resubmit decision from the previous deadline, you should already have received instructions by email on how to prepare the revision submission. At submission time, please tick the appropriate box in HotCRP for the Fall submission, and also provide the required additional information (Spring submission paper #, supplemental material, and summary of revision).</p>
			
			<h3 class="section-subheading">Author Response</h3>			
			
			<p>Author responses will be strictly limited to 1000 words. Providing a response in a PDF file (in which the number of words is not easy to detect) or inlining documents such as revised figures into the response will result in the response being removed.</p>
			
			<h3 class="section-subheading">Accepted Papers and Artifact Evaluation</h3>			
			
			<p>Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors are encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process.</p>

			<p style="background-color:#FDF2E9;"> 
			NOTE: For each accepted paper, at least one full registration fee (ACM member or non-member) will be required, even if the presenter is eligible for a student fee.
