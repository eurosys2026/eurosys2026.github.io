                    <p>The EuroSys 2026 organizing committee is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for all participants. We believe that our community is strengthened by the open exchange of ideas from a wide range of backgrounds. Our goal is to create a welcoming and respectful atmosphere that enables all attendees to participate fully.</p>
                    <p>We operate under the <a href="https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion" target="_blank">ACM Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy</a> and have adopted the following plan to guide our efforts:</p>

                    <h4>Committee and Reviewer Diversity</h4>
                    <p>We have strived to build an organizing committee and program committee that are diverse across multiple dimensions, including gender, institution, seniority, geography, and industry vs. academia. This is critical for ensuring a fair and representative review process.</p>

                    <h4>Unbiased Review Process</h4>
                    <p>To mitigate subconscious bias, the paper submission and review process will be double-blind. We will provide guidance to reviewers on conducting fair and unbiased reviews.</p>

                    <h4>Student Travel and Registration Grants</h4>
                    <p>We will offer grants to students to help them attend the conference. The selection process will consider diversity, equity, and inclusion as a key factor, alongside merit, and financial need, with the goal of supporting students from underrepresented groups.</p>

                    <h4>Inclusive On-Site Experience</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> We are committed to ensuring the conference venue is accessible to all. Please contact the organizers if you have specific accessibility needs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
                    <p>We strictly enforce our <a href="code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all. All attendees are required to adhere to this policy.</p>

                    <h4>Feedback</h4>
                    <p>We welcome feedback on our DEI efforts. Please feel free to contact the General Chairs or the Diversity & Inclusion Chairs with any suggestions or concerns. Contact information can be found on the <a href="organization-committee.html">Organizing Committee page</a>.</p>
